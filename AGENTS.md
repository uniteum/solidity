# AGENTS.md — Shared Solidity Infrastructure

> AI instructions for the `uniteum/crucible` submodule.

## What This Repo Is

This is a **shared infrastructure submodule** consumed by all `uniteum/*` Solidity repos.
It provides configuration and base scripts but has no `src/` contracts or tests of its own.

See the [Symlinks table in README.md](README.md#symlinks) for which files
consumer repos symlink and which are consumed differently.

## Symlink Architecture

Consumer repos add this as a git submodule at `lib/crucible/` and symlink
specific files into their repo root. The **single source of truth** for what
gets symlinked is the [Symlinks table in README.md](README.md#symlinks).

### When Adding New Files

When a new file is added to this repo, **ask the user** whether consumer repos
should symlink it. If yes, update the Symlinks table and the setup commands in
`README.md`. The user will need to create the symlinks in each consumer repo
separately.

## Editing Guidelines

### foundry.toml

- This is the **single source of truth** for Foundry configuration across all uniteum repos
- Changes here affect every consumer repo on their next `git submodule update`
- Be conservative — prefer per-repo `FOUNDRY_*` env var overrides for repo-specific needs
- Keep RPC endpoints pointing to free public RPCs (no API keys)

### .claude/rules/solidity.md

- These rules apply to all Solidity files in every consumer repo
- Keep rules general — repo-specific rules belong in the consumer repo's own `.claude/` directory
- The `paths` frontmatter controls which files trigger the rules

### .claude/rules/crucible-tests.md

- These rules apply to all `.sol` files under `test/` in every consumer repo
- Covers shared test architecture: User pattern, no `vm.prank`, file naming, test style
- Project-specific test rules belong in the consumer repo's `test/CLAUDE.md`

### .gitignore

- Covers common patterns across Solidity, Node.js, frontend, and deployment artifacts
- Consumer repos can add their own `.gitignore` for repo-specific exclusions

### README.md

- Primary audience: developers adding or updating the submodule in their repos
- Keep the Symlinks table and setup commands current with actual repo contents

## Do Not

- Add project-specific contracts or tests — this repo provides shared infrastructure only
- Add secrets, API keys, or private RPC endpoints
- Break backward compatibility in foundry.toml without coordinating across consumer repos
- Modify files expecting them to only affect one repo — changes propagate everywhere
